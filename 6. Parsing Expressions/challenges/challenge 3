skipping challenge because I'm not sure how to implement it

I think basically I should replace the "Expr expr = (higher precedence)" line
at the beginning of each production function with a try catch block, but then
initializing expr gets messed up and I'm not sure how to proceed without
changing a lot of stuff...
