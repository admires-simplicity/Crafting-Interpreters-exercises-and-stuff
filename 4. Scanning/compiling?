I've been having trouble compiling this because I don't really understand how the java class/module/package system works

these two answers have helped somewhat

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17973970/how-can-i-solve-java-lang-noclassdeffounderror

here's what I've found works so far:
I have Lox.java in directory /home/user/Crafting\ Interpreters/4.\ Scanning/
javac -cp /home/user/Crafting\ Interpreters/4.\ Scanning/ Lox.java
mv Lox.class com/craftinginterpreters/lox
java -cp /home/user/Crafting\ Interpreters/4.\ Scanning/ com/craftinginterpreters/lox/Lox

and fortunately relative paths seem to work, so what I'm actually using is
javac -cp . Lox.java
mv Lox.class com/craftinginterpreters/lox
java -cp . com/craftinginterpreters/lox/Lox

I don't really understand which files need to be where when, but this works for now...
